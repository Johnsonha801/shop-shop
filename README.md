# Redux - Shop shop

## Description

Shop-Shop is an e-commerce application that offers a variety of goods that users can shop for. Users can create an account and add items to their cart so that they can shop for multiple items at once. Due to new use cases, this application has been recreated with a redux global store so that users can use the application with the assurance that state will be coming from a single source of truth and provide an overall better experience. This application was made using the MERN stack and has integrated Stripejs as the means to capture payments. PWA design was included in the design so that users can experience the application even if they are offline. The cart
